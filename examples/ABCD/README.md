# *ABCD* example

This serves as a simple example of a dynamic slideshow.

## Idea

- An initial slide shows the letter 'A' fading in.

- The next slide shows the letter 'B' fading in.

- The following slide shows the letter 'C' fading in.

- From here, three secondary branch/paths can be followed:

  - One path goes to a slide showing a detailed description of the letter 'A'.

  - One path goes to a slide showing a detailed description of the letter 'B'.

  - One path goes to a slide showing a detailed description of the letter 'C'.
